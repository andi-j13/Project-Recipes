# Project-Recipes
As part of my Software Developer Level 4 Apprenticeship, I am required to successfully complete a handful of projects. For this project I am required to design and develop a website. 

I have decided to lead on from an old project of mine and build an interactive recipe website.

## Aims For This Project 
To successfully complete my task I must include the following:
* HTML code
* Styled appropriately using CSS
* Content inserted using JavaScript and/or JQuery
* Multimedia components 
* Interactive features within the website
* Commented code highlighting what different parts of the website do

To ensure good practices, I will also make sure to use good indentation and code layouts.
